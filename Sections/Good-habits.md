# Good Habits to Develop for a Clean and Clear Recording
A good, clean, and clear recording can save you a lot of trouble when you begin to edit your audio project. From paying attention to your microphone placement to reduce plosive to monitoring your recording levels, these tips and habits can help you with creating a recording that requires minimal edits.    

## Understanding where Sound is Picking Up from  
As you set up your microphone, you should take note on how it is picking up sound. Depending on its polar pattern, where you point your microphone will impact your recording. Below are some common polar patterns you might encounter.

        <td>Microphones with this pattern picks up sound from every direction. Notice that the bold lines encircles the entire recording area. Omnidirectional microphones can be really good for ambient recording where you may want to record sound from 360 degree but may introduce a lot of background noise in voice recording.</td>

        <td><a href="Images/Polar_pattern_cardioid.png">Cardioid</a> (Cardioid)</td>
        <td>Microphones with this pattern picks up sound in a single direction (forward-facing). Sound that falls outside of the bold lines is not going to be picked up in your recording. This can be useful for recording voice when you want to minimize picking up surrounding noise. This also means that if you fail to point the microphone in the direction of the sound you want to pick up, you will not be able to get a clean sound/sound is muffled.</td>

        <td>Microphones with this pattern picks up sound in 2 direction or in a figure-eight shape. Sound that falls outside of the bold lines is not going to be picked up in your recording, making it useful for recording environment where the interviewer and narrator and seated opposite each other.</td>

These are three of the polar patterns that you may encounter with your microphones. More importantly, knowing where (i.e. the direction) your microphone is picking up sound from is the first step to a clean recording. If you're using your laptop's microphone and not sure of its polar pattern or directionality, it may be useful to do a recording test to find out. For example, record a full sentence facing the middle of your laptop, then the four corners, can help you find where your microphone is and the direction of the recording.

## Check your Levels!
As you are recording, you should also pay attention to your recording levels. A good rule-of-thumb is to record between -15db to -12db for speech recording.

This will give you enough headroom for occasional spikes in volume, for example, clapping and laughing, without clipping your recording. Some recording devices/softwares/app also use color as another visual cue for monitoring; anything above -12db is usually yellow, and above -6db is in the red zone. As an indication, 0db on the monitoring level is the maximum limit of your recording device to pick up sound. Getting to 0db will result in clipping, which is when the audio signal is amplified past the maximum limit of your recording device. You will hear distortion and fuzziness in your recording as you put your recording device into overdrive.  

While the visual cue may be helpful, the best way to check is to monitor your recording. Some recording software/app and/or microphones allow you to monitor live (e.g. your headphone/earphone is plugged directly into your microphone (input source)) letting you adjust your input levels "live" by either re-positioning your microphone and/or tweaking your gain levels. In other cases, you can always record a small clip before going into your formal recording to make sure that your levels are good.  

## And now... Your Mouth Placement and Habits
If you're recording voice, where your mouth is placed in relation to your microphone will impact the quality of your recording. 

### "Fist-size" 
A good rule of thumb is to make sure your mouth is about 4-6 inches from your microphone, or about distance of your fist. If you're noticing a lot of plosives in your recording, you can also aim the microphone at your chin instead of directly in front of your mouth. 

### Plosives/P-pops
It's hard to avoid plosives in our speech. That's the result of little puffs of air being exhaled harshly when we pronounce words with "p" sounds. If pointing the microphone to your chin does not reduce plosive enough, you may consider a pop filter (soft material rather than metal ones) to absorb some of the impact before it reaches your microphone. 

A good way to check your microphone placement for plosives is to record "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."

### Sibilance
Another sound that may be difficult to avoid are sibilance or "s" sounds in our speech. Like plosive, you can try different microphone placements to reduce the pick-up of such sounds. 

A good way to check the recording of sibilance is to record "She sells seashells at the seashore."

### Mouth Noises
Mouth noises include sounds like lip smacking and slurping or when you're speaking with a lot of saliva in your mouth. NPR recommends sipping apple juice (instead of water or coffee) to avoid some of the mouth noises we generate when we speak.   

In this section, we offer some things to look out for as you're preparing for your recording, if you would like to hear some examples and explore other tips, [NPR's Ear Training Guide](https://training.npr.org/2017/01/31/the-ear-training-guide-for-audio-producers/) can be a very helpful checklist.
