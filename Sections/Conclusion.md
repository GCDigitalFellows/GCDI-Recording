# Conclusion

We hope that this workshop is helpful to starting your audio project. In our [synchronous session](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/event/getting-good-enough-audio-recording-hybrid/) on **Thursday, October 1st 2020 @ 2pm**, we will discuss the materials shared here. 

In preparation for our synchronous discussion, it would be useful if you could also fill in [this short survey](https://forms.gle/utMT2cR9XxC9PmUa8) before our meeting. 

For those who are attending our synchronous session, see you soon! If you're a The Graduate Center, CUNY affiliate and are not able to attend the session, please feel free to join our [sound studies working group](http://cuny.is/sound-studies) and/or contact us via our [consultation form](http://cuny.is/gcdi-consults).
