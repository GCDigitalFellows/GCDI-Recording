# Setting up your Home Studio
As we prepare for recording at home, we also have to pay attention to the room tone of our recording environment. A good way to do so is to check your room tone before beginning your formal recording. 

## Room tone
Electronic appliances, such as your computer, emit sound and vibration that our ears have learned to filter out. Our microphones, however, do not usually have the ability to do so and will pick up all the sound in our environment. This sound is generally considered the room tone. What does your room sound like before you begin your formal recording?

Recording your room tone will give you an idea of what your microphone is picking up and may be helpful for your to identify the source of white noises. Generally, you will want to turn off any electronic appliances/devices that you can or move to an environment that has minimal interference. Recording at least 30 seconds of your room tone before you begin formal recording can also help you in creating a baseline for noise-reduction in post-recording cleaning as well.

## Echo
You may notice that in recording studios, the walls are lined with foams shaped like egg cartons. This is to minimize the audio from bouncing back into the microphone. Rooms with many hard surfaces will result in echo as sound bounces off these surfaces back into your microphone. Sound will bounce of walls, tables, and computer screens, and if you're in a room with many angular walls, the echo may be even more pronounced. A way to get around it in a home studio is to record in a blanket fort or even in your closet! The soft cloth surrounding your microphone will help minimize the echo and absorb some of the sound. 

## Microphone placement
In the previous section we discussed microphone placement in relation to your mouth/input source. Here, it is also useful to pay attention to where the microphone is so that you don't accidentally brush against it in your process of recording. If you place your microphone on your table, the vibrations caused by accidentally hitting the table will also be picked up in the recording. Ensuring your microphone is placed in a way to prevent these accidental touches will ensure a cleaner recording.

## Sound Samples
Below you will find some samples of audio recording using different microphones and different room treatment. The first 30 seconds of each recording is a recording of the room tone based on the microphone and corresponding treatment. Give them a listen and note down what is different amongst the recording.

The smartphone recording is recorded on the android [Voice Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.media.bestrecorder.audiorecorder&hl=en_US) app. For both the USB microphone and webcam microphone recording they are recorded in an empty Zoom session. We will discuss in the next sections considerations for different recording software and applications.
