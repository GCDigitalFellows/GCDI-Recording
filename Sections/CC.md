# Creative Commons Licensing
If you're planning to use audio materials that are not of your own, you want to make sure that you have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you would like to add background music to your podcast episode, you want to make sure that you're allowed to use the music. In the infograph below, made by [WILEY](https://www.wiley.com/network/researchers/licensing-and-open-access/infographic-everything-you-need-to-know-about-creative-commons-licenses), it breaks down the different types of Creative Commons licenses available as alternatives to copyrights.

There are many music that can be used under CC licensing. For example, you can check out [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/static). For how you might cite/use your CC music, check out [FMA's FAQ](https://freemusicarchive.org/FAQ_For_Educators). 

If you're interested in using oral history interviews, you will have to check the licensing and distribution rights of the archives you're getting the interviews from. Not all archives allow you to use their interviews or they may have specific requirements for usage (e.g. no remixing/editing of clips). Make sure to check the appropriate rights before you include them in your own recording. This also upholds the rights of the narrators and respects their intentions in distribution.
