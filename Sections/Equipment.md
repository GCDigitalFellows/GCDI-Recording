# Equipments for Audio Recording
As you think about your recording project, you may be wondering if you would have to buy new equipments. Chances are, you already have the equipment that you need to get started! 

## What Equipments Do I Need to Get Started?
The intention of the workshop is to work with what you have and work with resources readily available to you. You can get started on an audio recording with the following audio equipment:  

- Smartphones/Laptops/Chromebooks/Tablets
- Headphones/Earphones  

You will notice that the list is not very long! If you have a smart device that has a build-in microphone and a recording app/software, you're ready to go! You will need a headphone/earphone to help you with monitoring your audio recording, though if you don't have one, the speakers on your device will provide you with some information about your recorded audio.    

If you can choose between your smartphone and laptop/chromebook/tablet, the better microphone is usually your smartphone because... your smartphone is meant for voice-calls! By comparison, the microphone in your smartphone picks up and isolate voice better. It is also easier for you to place your smart phone in a better position for picking up sound than a larger device such as your laptop.   

When you use your headphone/earphone, make sure it does not have active noise cancelling or that you can turn it off. Active noise cancelling may remove the background noise in your monitoring/playbacks, and you may miss it in your actual recording. If you have to use your devices' speakers for monitoring, you may not be able to pick up on some of the background noise or interference in your recording.   

Headphones/earphones with build-in microphones may not always be ideal as it is not as easy to isolate the microphone from interference or accidentally recording unwanted white noise. For example, you might accidentally brush against the microphone with your hands or your hair or your clothes, introducing noise into your recording.  

## What Equipments are Nice to Have?
If you have some budget for additional equipments, you can consider:

- an external microphone 
- an external digital recorder, and/or
- a pop filter

An external microphone, such as an USB microphone like the [Blue Snowball](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/snowball/) can help you with getting a cleaner audio recording. A USB microphone plugs directly into your device's USB drive and is usually recognized as an audio input. You may have also heard of microphones with an XLR connection and that's another common audio input for recording! XLR microphones usually require an additional interface to connect with your computer and is usually more expensive than USB microphones. For more information comparing the two types of input, you can check out [Podcast.co's article](https://www.podcast.co/create/usb-vs-xlr-microphone).   

An external digital recorder, such as the [Tascam DR-05X](https://tascam.com/us/product/dr-05x/top), is useful for an outdoor recording, when bringing a computer may be challenging. Usually, in such scenarios, you will also pair your external recorder with a [lavalier microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone-Bundle-Clip/dp/B082M9W4G1/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=lavalier+microphone&qid=1601325588&s=musical-instruments&sr=1-4) if you're recording voice, such as in an interview. Even if you're not recording in an outdoor setting, an external digital recorder can also serve as a useful back-up for your home-studio recording environment.

A pop filter is useful to help you reduce some of the plosives in our speech (e.g. when we pronounce words with "p" sounds). In a home-recording scenario, this can help with getting a cleaner sound. In the next section, we will discuss other ways to reduce plosives and good habits in recording.
