# Software/Application Recommendation
While it is beyond the scope of this workshop to cover how to record and edit in specific programs, below are some software and application suggestions that will help you get started.

If you're recording on a laptop/computer that runs a Mac, Windows, or GNU/Linux operating system, [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is a great open-source software that will also allow you to do basic editing. You can directly record on Audacity or choose to import a recording to edit instead. 

Alternatively, if you have a Mac, you can also use Garageband, which is available free and comes with most Macs. You can also use Garageband on your iPads and iPhones. 

In both Audacity and Garageband, you are able to choose the format* of your recording. 

If you're recording on your phone, there are many applications available for either iOS or Android. If you don't want to use the build-in recording application on your phone, you can consider [Voice Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.media.bestrecorder.audiorecorder&hl=en_US) on Android and [Voice Recorder & Audio Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-recorder-audio-editor/id685310398) on iOS. Choose an application that will gives you some flexibility on your recording format. Ideally, you want to be able to record in an uncompressed format.

If you're only able to record on the cloud or use web-based applications, you can also consider [Anchor](https://help.anchor.fm/hc/en-us/sections/360004178272-Getting-Started-with-Anchor) as an alternative for recording. Anchor is a podcast distribution platform owned by Spotify and is currently available for free. You don't have to have the intention to distribute a podcast to be able to use the recording function. It will record in a compressed format but has some basic editing functionality on its web application. Anchor is also available as an application on Android and iOS.

## A Note on Recording Format*
For your original recording, you want to record in an uncompressed format, such as a .WAV file that will give you as much information as it was recorded for post-recording manipulation. The resulting file size is typically much larger than a compressed format. A compressed format such as .mp3 removes details about the recording that our human ears cannot perceive. However, because this is a digital compression, depending on the models used, different distortion may be introduced in the audio file, especially if you are planning to edit your recording. Editing a digital recording will add digital distortion, hence, if you're working with a compressed file format, you're already beginning your editing process with a distorted file in which you are going to introduce more (controlled) distortion.

Remember, you can always compress your recording when you're ready to share but not do the opposite with compressed recording (cannot make compressed recording uncompressed). 

Generally, recording and editing in an uncompressed format at 16-bit (for voice) or 24-bit/32-bit (for music), and 44.1kHz (CD audio quality) is ideal (large file size). Depending on the purpose of your recording, you may then choose to export it in an compressed format, keeping the same bits and Hertz, for distribution (small file size). To learn more about the differences, you can refer to [iZotope's article](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/whats-the-difference-between-file-formats.html).
