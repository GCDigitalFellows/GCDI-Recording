# Getting Good (Enough) Audio Recording

## Original Workshop Abstract
As we continue to work from home, this has sparked renewed interest in the possibilities of audio recording. While there may be many different ways of doing audio recording, this hybrid workshop will focus on understanding what a good (enough) audio recording is for podcasting, interviewing, and streaming and how that might be achieved in a home-setting. We will discuss how to create a good recording environment and possible platforms for sharing audio files.  

## Credits
This workshop was developed and written by [Di Yoong](https://diyoong.info/).

## Workshops
It was first taught at CUNY GC by Di Yoong in Fall 2020 as a two hour online syncronous workshop. 

## Requirements
- No prior requirement needed to get started. The workshop is targeted to build foundational skills and how to set up a basic home studio. 

## Reception and Feedback
General feedback was good. Participants would appreciate more hands-on experiences and future workshops to build on these skills.

## Needed/Desired Changes 
- More hands-on challenges could help support students in thinking about how to apply the skills.
- When moving offline, practicing some of the tips for interviewing will be one hands-on exercise that can be helpful for participants.
