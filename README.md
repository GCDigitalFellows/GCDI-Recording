This repository hosts the materials for the asynchronous portion of the workshop - *Getting Good (Enough) Audio Recording.* (Fall 2020)

## Workshop Abstract
As we continue to work from home, this has sparked renewed interest in the possibilities of audio recording. While there may be many different ways of doing audio recording, this hybrid workshop will focus on understanding what a good (enough) audio recording is for podcasting, interviewing, and streaming and how that might be achieved in a home-setting. We will discuss how to create a good recording environment and possible platforms for sharing audio files.
