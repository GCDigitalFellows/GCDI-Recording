This repository hosts the materials for the asynchronous portion of the workshop - *Getting Good (Enough) Audio Recording.* The event description is as follow:
As we continue to work from home, this has sparked renewed interest in the possibilities of audio recording. While there may be many different ways into audio recording, this hybrid workshop will focus on understanding what a good (enough) audio recording is for podcasting, interviewing, and streaming and how that might be achieved in a home-setting. We will discuss how to create a good recording environment and possible platforms for sharing audio files. The first part of the workshop is conducted asynchronously with the synchronous meeting time focusing on support.
