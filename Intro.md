# Getting Good (Enough) Audio Recording

## Introduction 
Welcome to the workshop on *Getting Good (Enough) Audio Recording*! 
Before beginning your audio recording project, it is useful to first consider what your project is going to be used for, who your audience is, and where you might be distributing your recordings. These questions will guide you in your decisions about what will be good enough for your purpose. For example, you may need to prioritize having a small file size for streaming, while having a clean sound may be important for a podcast episode. For this workshop, we will be focusing on recording in a home-studio, beginning with discussing the equipments necessary for an audio recording and conclude with considerations for using already available audio materials alongside your own recordings.

- Understand the equipments for audio recording
- Practice good recording habits
